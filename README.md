### Visual Studio Code configuration

This files are simply my personal configuration for visual studio code to be able to back it up.

These files are made for OSX since it overrides some shortcuts is overriden. 

For example the `editor.action.format`' shortcut `alt+shift+F` is overriden with `shift+cmd+f` to avoid
conflicts with the search the international qwerty keyboard.
